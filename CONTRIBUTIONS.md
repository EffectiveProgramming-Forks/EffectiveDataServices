### Pull Requests

* If you would like to contribute some code - awesome! I just ask that you make it conform to the
coding conventions already set forth and to add a couple of tests for your new code. Of course,
the code should be of use to more than just a couple of folks. When you're ready, please send me
a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
